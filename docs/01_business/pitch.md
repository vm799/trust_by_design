# JobProof v2 - Elevator Pitch

## The Problem

Field service companies lose $50,000-500,000/year from:
- Disputed work claims ("You didn't fix that!")
- Insurance claim rejections (insufficient documentation)
- Invoice payment delays (clients want proof)
- Worker's comp fraud (no evidence of site conditions)
- Legal liability (no audit trail of safety compliance)

## Our Solution

**JobProof v2** is a **professional-grade evidence documentation platform** that creates **cryptographically sealed, timestamped, geolocated photo evidence**.

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Audit-ready** (comprehensive documentation trail)
- ✅ **Instantly accessible** (magic links, no app install)
- ✅ **Offline-first** (works in basements, remote sites)
- ✅ **Integration-ready** (CRM, QuickBooks, insurance portals)

## Target Market

- **Primary:** MEP Contractors (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing)
- **Secondary:** Infrastructure Auditors, Property Management, Facilities Management
- **Market Size:** 400,000+ field service companies in US ($60B annual revenue)

## Business Model

B2B SaaS Subscription:
- Starter: $49/month (5-25 jobs/month)
- Professional: $99/month (25-100 jobs/month)

## Value Proposition

### For Field Service Companies:
1. **Reduce DSO** (Days Sales Outstanding) - Instant professional reports = faster invoice approval
2. **Eliminate Disputes** - 100% verifiable evidence reduces "he-said/she-said" to zero
3. **Lower Insurance Premiums** - Auditable safety workflows = lower risk profile
4. **Zero Training** - Browser-based magic links = 95% technician adoption

### ROI Example:
