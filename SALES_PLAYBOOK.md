# PART 1: CORE NARRATIVE

## 1. The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)
"Field service companies lose up to **$50,000 a year** in disputed invoices and insurance claim rejections because they lack verifiable proof of work.

**JobProof** fixes this instantly. It’s a browser-based tool that lets technicians capture **cryptographically sealed, timestamped, and geolocated photo evidence** without downloading an app. It gives you legally defensible proof that ensures you get paid, every time."

## 2. The Problem (Pain Points)
*   **The "He-Said, She-Said" Dispute:** Client says "You didn't fix the leak." Technician says "I did." Without proof, you lose the invoice.
*   **Insurance Rejections:** Claims denied because photos don't prove *when* or *where* they were taken.
*   **Technician Resistance:** Techs refuse to download complex apps or forget passwords.
*   **Lost Revenue:** Average field service co. writes off 3-5% of revenue due to disputes.

## 3. The Solution (Value Props)
*   **Magic Links (Zero Friction):** No app store. No login. Techs just click a text message link. 95% adoption rate.
*   **Offline-First:** Works perfectly in basements, elevators, and rural dead zones. Syncs automatically.
*   **Immutable Trust:** We don't just "save" photos; we **seal** them with banking-grade encryption. It holds up in court.
*   **Dual-Signal Location:** We verify presence using **GPS** AND **what3words** (precise 3x3m addressing).

# PART 2: SALES FLUENCY & OBJECTION HANDLING

## 1. Feature -> Benefit Translation

| Feature | The "So What?" (Benefit) |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Cryptographic Sealing** | "Your invoice becomes undeniable. It ends the argument before it starts." |
| **IndexedDB Offline Mode** | "Your guys never have an excuse to miss a photo, even in a concrete basement." |
| **Magic Links** | "You don't need to be IT support. It just opens. Zero training time." |
| **QuickBooks Integration** | "Turn a photo report into a paid invoice in one click." |

## 2. Common Objections ("Rebuttals")

**Objection:** "We already use ServiceTitan / Housecall Pro."
**Rebuttal:** "Great! Those are amazing for scheduling. But they are totally open—anyone can edit a photo or fudge a timestamp. JobProof is for *high-stakes* documentation. We integrate with them to add the 'Legal Proof' layer they are missing."

**Objection:** "My guys won't use another app."
**Rebuttal:** "That's exactly why we built this. There is NO app. If they can open a text message, they can use JobProof. Adoption takes 30 seconds."

**Objection:** "$99/month seems high."
**Rebuttal:** "What is your average invoice size? $500? If JobProof saves you just **one** disputed invoice every 5 months, it pays for itself. Most clients save that in week one."

# PART 3: MARKET CONTEXT

## 1. Target User Profiles
*   **The Owner (Bob):** Stressed about cash flow and "cowboy" technicians. Wants control and payment.
*   **The Office Manager (Sarah):** Hates chasing techs for photos. Wants reports to organize themselves.
*   **The Technician (Mike):** Hates admin work. Wants to get the job done and go home.

## 2. Pricing Tier Strategy
*   **Starter ($49/mo):** Solo contractors. Pitch: "Cheaper than one lost hour of work."
*   **Professional ($99/mo):** Small teams (up to 10). Pitch: "Team accountability & insurance compliance."
*   **Enterprise (Custom):** 50+ Techs. Pitch: "API Integration, SOC2 Compliance, White-labeling."

## 3. Competitive Landscape
*   **ServiceTitan:** Expensive ($200+/mo), complex, app-based. We are faster and simpler.
*   **WhatsApp/SMS:** The current "competitor." Zero organization, zero legal proof.
*   **CompanyCam:** Great for photos, but lacks the "Cryptographic Seal" and specific "Proof" focus.

# PART 4: DEMO SCRIPTS

## The "Magic" Moment
"I want you to take out your phone right now. I'm texting you a link. Don't install anything. Just click it. (Pause). See that? You're already in the job. Take a photo of your coffee cup. Hit submit. Done. That photo is now legally sealed and on my dashboard. That is how fast your technicians will work."
